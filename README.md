## Day Scheduler

## Description
Used the JQuery Library, javascript, and Moment.js, to create a simple work day scheduler that allows the user to enter text and save the contents to local storage. Time periods in the past show gray, the current time block shows red, and future time blocks show as green. 
My motivation for building this was to reinforce Javascript, time, and local storage concepts. This project stands out with its simplicity and ease of use. 

## Installation
Open the HTML file in any web browser to utilize the application. No further installation is needed
